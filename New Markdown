# New Markdown File
## Problem
Took me awhile to figure out how to add a new file
Attempted to use the GitHub desktop app to do it, but it didn't seem to work
## Solution
Went to YouTube to look for some help
Most were using the web app and just clicked on new file, I did the same and _look at me now!_

Apparently this is just a new file. Confused as to what a markdown really is. 
Anyways, I chose the apache license because it was the first one that popped up. Not sure if it's because it was alphabetical or if the most commonly used license. 
Made another edit to get pull request to show up, lets see if it worked.
