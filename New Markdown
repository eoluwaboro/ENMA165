#New Markdown File
##Problem
Took me awhile to figure out how to add a new file
Attempted to use the GitHub desktop app to do it, but it didn't seem to work
##Solution
Went to YouTube to look for some help
Most were using the web app and just clicked on new file, I did the same and _look at me now!_
